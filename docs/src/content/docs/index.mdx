## Welcome

Welcome to the **LLM Post-Training** educational project! This hands-on guide will teach you how to transform a pre-trained language model into a helpful AI assistant.

## The Problem

Pre-trained language models like GPT, Llama, or Qwen are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. While impressive, they have a fundamental limitation:

**They don't follow instructions.**

Try asking a base model a simple question:

```
Human: What is the capital of France?
Base Model: is it Paris or Lyon? I think it's probably Paris but I'm not completely
sure. I've heard that Lyon is sometimes considered the...
```

The model just continues the text pattern - it doesn't understand you want a direct answer!

## The Solution: Post-Training

Post-training is the process of teaching pre-trained models to:
- Follow instructions
- Give helpful, harmless, honest responses
- Align with human preferences
- Behave like assistants, not text generators

## Post-Training Techniques

This project implements all major post-training approaches:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)" icon="pencil">
    Train on (instruction, response) pairs to teach instruction-following.

    **Starts here** - the foundation of all post-training.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Reward Modeling" icon="star">
    Train models to predict which responses humans prefer.

    Essential for RLHF approaches.
  </Card>

  <Card title="RLHF with PPO" icon="rocket">
    Use reinforcement learning to optimize for human preferences.

    Classic approach used by InstructGPT, GPT-4, Claude.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)" icon="approve-check">
    Skip reward modeling - optimize preferences directly.

    Simpler and often more stable than RLHF.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## The Journey

Here's the typical post-training pipeline:

```
Pre-trained Model (base model, just predicts next tokens)
        ↓
[Supervised Fine-Tuning]
        ↓
SFT Model (follows instructions, but not optimized for preferences)
        ↓
[Reward Modeling] → Reward Model (predicts human preferences)
        ↓
[RLHF with PPO] or [DPO]
        ↓
Aligned Model (helpful, harmless, honest assistant)
```

## Why This Matters

Modern AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all use post-training. Understanding these techniques helps you:

1. **Build better AI systems** - Know how to adapt models to your needs
2. **Understand AI behavior** - See why models respond the way they do
3. **Debug issues** - Identify problems in fine-tuning
4. **Research effectively** - Contribute to alignment research

## What You'll Build

In this project, you'll:

- ✅ Download and prepare a pre-trained model (Llama 3.2 1B)
- ✅ Implement Supervised Fine-Tuning with LoRA
- ✅ Train a reward model on preference data
- ✅ Implement RLHF with PPO
- ✅ Implement DPO as an alternative
- ✅ Compare all approaches

All with **comprehensive documentation** explaining every step!
